# Favicon Setup

This project references `/favicon.ico` but the actual favicon file is not included in the repository.

To add a favicon:

1. Create a 16x16 or 32x32 pixel ICO file
2. Place it in the root directory as `favicon.ico`
3. Alternatively, you can use an online favicon generator:
   - https://favicon.io/
   - https://realfavicongenerator.net/

For a quick placeholder, you can create a simple SVG favicon and convert it, or use a text-based favicon generator.

The manifest.webmanifest also references the favicon, so make sure it exists for PWA support.
